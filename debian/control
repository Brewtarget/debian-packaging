Description: GUI beer brewing software
 Brewtarget is a calculator for brewing beer. It is a Qt-based program which
 allows you to create recipes from a database of ingredients. It calculates all
 the important parameters, helps you with mash temperatures, and just makes the
 process of recipe formulation much easier.
