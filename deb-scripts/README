This directory constains scripts for packaging a proper debian archive.

createorig.sh:
	Move this script and debian/ to repo-dir/../ and execute ./createorig.sh repo-dir
        to create the *orig.tar.gz
	and brewtarget-<version>/ for packaging. Then, you can cd to
	brewtarget-<version>/ and execute "dpkg-buildpackage" to create a
	proper package.
